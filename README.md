## Overview
The project consists of the following key steps:
1. **Data Import and Exploration:** Loading the dataset, understanding its structure, and identifying initial patterns.
2. **Data Visualization:** Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis to uncover relationships between features.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and treating outliers to ensure data quality.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features and removing irrelevant ones for better model performance.
5. **Model Building:** Developing and evaluating multiple regression models using `LinearRegression` and `Ridge`.

## Executive Summary
This report delves into the interesting relationship between various factors and house prices. Through comprehensive data analysis and machine learning techniques, we are able uncover key insights and actionable recommendations. Our findings highlight the significance of location, property size, and construction year in determining housing values. Furthermore, we see the impact of outliers and the effectiveness of regularization techniques in improving model performance.

## Key Findings

### Core Features:
- **GrLivArea**: A strong positive correlation exists between the above-ground living area and sale price. Larger houses 
    command higher prices.
- **Bathrooms and Bedrooms**: Additional bathrooms and bedrooms positively impact the sale price, albeit to a lesser 
    extent than living area.
- **Neighborhood**: Certain neighborhoods consistently have higher-priced houses, indicating their desirability or 
    exclusivity.
- **Year Built**: Newer houses often fetch higher prices, reflecting the premium placed on modern construction and 
  amenities.

### Analysis Observations
**Data Quality and Preprocessing:**
To ensure data quality, data preprocessing steps, included feature scaling and handling missing values, which are crucial for model accuracy.

1. **Outliers:**
   - Outliers in variables like `GrLivArea` and `n_hot_rooms` were identified and addressed by capping to reduce their    
   impact.
   - Low values in `rainfall` were adjusted to remove anomalies.

2. **Missing Values:**
   - The column `n_hos_beds` had missing values filled with the mean.

3. **Feature Transformations:**
   - Log transformation was applied to `crime_rate` to normalize its distribution.
   - Average distance (`avg_dist`) was computed as a new feature.

4. **Dummy Variables:**
   - Categorical variables were encoded to prepare the dataset for regression.

5. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - A heatmap highlighted the relationships between variables, aiding in feature selection.

## Insights
- **Room Number vs. Price:** A positive correlation indicates that more rooms generally lead to higher prices.

This scatter plot shows the relationship between the price of houses and the number of bedrooms (rooms). We can see a general upward trend, indicating that houses with more bedrooms tend to be more expensive.
  
- **Proximity Metrics:** Variables representing distances to amenities were reduced to a single averaged metric, 
    simplifying the dataset without losing information.
  
![Relationship Between Price and Number of Hotel Rooms](https://github.com/EngrIBGIT/House-Price-Prediction-Enhancing-Model-Accuracy/blob/main/JointPlt%20price_n_ht_rm.PNG)

This  explores the combined effect of neighborhood desirability, the hotels and number of rooms in hotels on 
house price.

![Correlation Heatmap](https://github.com/EngrIBGIT/House-Price-Prediction-Enhancing-Model-Accuracy/blob/main/CorrPlt.PNG)


This correlation matrix  shows the strength and direction of the relationships between the various features used to 
predict house price. Numbers closer to 1 indicate a strong positive correlation, while numbers closer to -1 indicate a 
strong negative correlation. Numbers close to 0 suggest little to no correlation.
  
- **Categorical Variables:** Features such as `airport`, rainfall and `waterbody` were found to significantly influence price.

![Relationship Between Price and Rainfall](https://github.com/EngrIBGIT/House-Price-Prediction-Enhancing-Model-Accuracy/blob/main/JointPlt%20price_rainfal.PNG)


This shows the relationship between house price and rainfall. It's interesting to see if a 
correlation, as rainfall impact factors like location desirability or construction costs.

### Model Performance:
- **Single-variable models**: Features like `room_num` provide reasonable predictions.
- **Multivariable models**: Incorporating multiple features offers more accurate and robust predictions.
- **Regularization techniques**: Methods such as Ridge regression help mitigate the impact of multicollinearity and improve model generalization.
- 
Validation Curve
![Validation Curve](https://github.com/EngrIBGIT/House-Price-Prediction-Enhancing-Model-Accuracy/blob/main/Val_curve.PNG)

This validation curve helps assess how the model performs with different hyperparameter settings. It is used to identify potential issues with overfitting or underfitting.


The visualization has given valuable insights into the factors influencing house prices helping to potentially improve the accuracy of the house price prediction model.

## Recommendations

### For Buyers:
- **Prioritize Location**: Invest in neighborhoods with strong growth potential and desirable amenities.
- **Consider Future Value**: Evaluate the long-term value of a property, factoring in infrastructure development and zoning changes.
- **Balance Size and Price**: Ensure the price aligns with the property's value and market trends.

### For Sellers:
- **Maximize Living Space**: Renovations that increase living area, especially bedrooms and bathrooms, can significantly boost property value.
- **Modernize and Upgrade**: Investing in modern amenities and energy-efficient features can attract buyers and command higher prices.
- **Strategic Marketing**: Target specific buyer segments based on location, property type, and lifestyle preferences.

### For Real Estate Agents:
- **Leverage Data Insights**: Use data-driven insights to provide tailored advice to clients.
- **Utilize Predictive Analytics**: Employ machine learning models to forecast future trends and identify potential opportunities.
- **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated on the latest market trends and technological advancements to remain competitive.



## Further Research
1. Enhance feature selection by including interaction terms or polynomial features for non-linear relationships.
2. Increase the R² score by using ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting or Random Forest.
3. Use cross-validation extensively to minimize overfitting.
4. Enhance model deployment using a user-friendly interface for real-world applicability.



## Conclusion
By understanding the underlying factors that influence house prices and leveraging data-driven insights, stakeholders in the real estate industry can make informed decisions and achieve optimal outcomes. As technology continues to advance, the integration of machine learning and data analytics will further revolutionize the real estate market.
